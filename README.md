It's easy to miss a trade opportunity via poe.trade in Path of Exile because you step away from the computer for a few moments.  In order to compelte a trade successfully, you often need to reply to the sender within a minute or so or they will move onto another seller.

This code monitors the Path of Exile log file for new user messages requesting a trade via poe.trade, or notification of
a disconnect from the server.  When one of these messages are detected, send a
message to a user or channel on Slack.

it around February 2017, so your success may vary.
